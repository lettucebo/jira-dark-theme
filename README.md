# Jira Dark Theme

> Welcome to the dark side. 

## Description

Simple Chrome extension that applies an inverted dark theme to Jira. Originally forked from radibit/jira-dark-theme. I edited from the original so that it isn't as jenky in the new jira style.

The extension simply applies an invert filter to all the content, and then uninverts as many of the images it can to rectify silly profile and project avatars.

## Installation

Download the code or clone the repo, activate developer mode in `chrome://extensions`,
and load the extension using `Load unpacked extension`.

If you don't like the little jira icon you get in your extensions toolbar, right click it and hide it!
